# Neural Differential Models


## Motivation
Differential equations provide a natural framework for modeling continuous dynamics. Neural ODEs and their extensions (e.g., flows, social ODEs, neural operators) unify deep learning with dynamical systems and offer new approaches for tasks such as:
- Modeling time series and trajectories  
- Multi-agent forecasting  
- Learning mappings between function spaces (PDEs)  
- Efficient continuous-time alternatives to traditional deep nets  

This repo collects experiments inspired by seminal works such as:
1. *Neural Ordinary Differential Equations*  
2. *Understanding Neural ODEs*  
3. *Neural Flows: Efficient Alternatives to Neural ODEs*  
4. *Social ODE: Multi-Agent Trajectory Forecasting*  
5. *Neural Operator: Learning Maps Between Function Spaces with Applications to PDEs*
